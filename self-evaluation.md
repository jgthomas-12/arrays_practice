- So far I feel pretty confident with arrays and their basic operations and expectations. I'm sure there are plenty more ways to manipulate and adjust them that will come over time. 

- I want to understand what was happening when I was using .shift(number). It was adjusting the printed value of the given array without adding the specfic numbers defined in the parenthesis. I'm unsure of the exact purpose of this specific array method. 

- I don't have any specific questions about arrays aside from wanting to know more about what was mentioned about .shift(n).
